Mila should select a hash because a hash is designed to be

Allow lists are lists of approved software. Software can only

Correlation dashboards are used to aggregate events and to

correlate events. A public key infrastructure (PKI) handles
certificates, not correlation and visibility of security events.

13. D. Containment efforts are used to limit the spread or impact of

The best option for Alaina would be to use a URL filter to
block users from visiting the link in the phishing email. A WAF,
or web application firewall, is designed to prevent attacks
against a web application. Patching can help stop exploits of
vulnerable services or systems, but this is a phishing attack, and
an allow list lists allowed items, not blocked items, and limiting
which websites an entire company can visit is almost impossible
in most circumstances.

Playbooks list the actions that an organization will take as
part of a response process. A runbook lists the steps required to
perform an action like notification, removing malware, or
similar tasks. Playbooks tend to be used to document processes,

recovery (DR) plan is used to recover from disasters, and a
business continuity (BC) plan is used to ensure that the
organization continues to function.

Gary should look at the trend information for malware

package, a successful attack that has resulted in staff members
clicking on malicious links or opening malicious emails, or other
paths into the organization. Gary could then check with users
whose systems reported the malware to see what had occurred.
Alerts might show the infections but would not show the data
over time as easily as trends. Sensors will show individual places
data is gathered, and bandwidth dashboards can show useful
information about which systems are using more or less
bandwidth, but the trends dashboard remains the right place for
him to look in this situation.
