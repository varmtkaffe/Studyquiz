Spear phishing is targeted to a specific group, in this case insurance professionals.

This describes a jamming attack, where legitimate traffic is interfered with by another signal. Jamming can be intentional or unintentional and may be intermittent. IV attacks are obscure cryptographic attacks on stream ciphers. Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS) uses a PIN to connect to the wireless access point (WAP). The WPS attack attempts to intercept that PIN in transmission, connect to the WAP, and then steal the WPA2 password. A botnet is a group of machines that are being used, without their consent, as part of an attack.

The simplest way to ensure that APIs are only used by

Memory leaks can cause crashes, resulting in an outage. This
targets the availability leg of the CIA (confidentiality, integrity,
and availability) triad, making it a security issue. Memory leaks
do not actually leak to other locations, nor do they allow code
injection. Instead memory leaks cause memory exhaustion or
other issues over time as memory is not properly reclaimed.

This question combines two pieces of knowledge: how
botnet command and control works, and that IRC's default port

the most likely answer given the information available is a
botnet that uses Internet Relay Chat (IRC) as its command-and-control channel.

Radio frequency identification (RFID) is commonly used for

a link or open an attachment. Shoulder surfing is literally
looking over someone's shoulder. In the on-path (man-in-the-middle) attack, the attacker is between the client and the server,
