Vendor diversity gives two security benefits. The first is that
there is no single point of failure should one vendor cease
operations. The second benefit is that each vendor has a specific
methodology and algorithms used for detecting malware. If you
use the same vendor at all points where you need malware
detection, any flaw or weakness in that vendor’s methodology
will persist across the network. Using a single vendor means that
any weakness in that vendor’s methodology or technology could
impact the entire system or network. Vendor forking is not a
term in the industry, and this is not a neutral act; vendor
diversity improves security.

In this scenario, the best fit to Scott's needs is a second

longer to restore, regardless of whether they are full or
incremental backups, although incremental backups can take
more time in some cases since swapping tapes in order can add
time to the restoration process. Finally, a cloud-based backup
system would be useful if Scott was worried about a local
disaster but would be slower than a local identical NAS, thus not
meeting Scott's primary requirement.
